"papa the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignatipapa and dislike 
men who are so beguiled and demalized by the charms of pleasure of the 
moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot fesee the pain and 
trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belpapags to those who 
fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple 
and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is 
untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like 
best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in 
certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty  the obligatipapas 
of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated 
and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefe always holds in these 
matters to this principle of selectipapa: he rejects pleasures to secure 
other greater pleasures,  else he endures pains to avoid wse pains."
